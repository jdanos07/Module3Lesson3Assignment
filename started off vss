Task 1: Flight Route Comparison Imagine you work for an airline and need to compare the flight routes of your airline with a competitor. You have two sets of flight destinations, one for each airline. Write a Python program to find out:

1. Destinations that both airlines fly to.

2. Destinations unique to your airline.

3. Whether there are any destinations that neither airline shares.

Example Code:

our_routes = {"LAX", "JFK", "CDG", "DXB"}
competitor_routes = {"JFK", "CDG", "LHR", "BKK"}
